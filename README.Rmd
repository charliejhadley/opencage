Geocode with the OpenCage API, either from placename to longitude and latitude (forward geocoding) or from longitude and latitude to placename (reverse geocoding). 

### Package functionality

There are a few R packages that provide forward and reverse geocoding, see how {opencage} compares to alternative solutions:

| Task                         | [opencage](https://github.com/ropensci/opencage) | [ggmap](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) | [tmaptools](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmaptools) 
|------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Available on CRAN            | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Requires API key             | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Underlying Geocoding service | [OpenCage Geocoder](https://opencagedata.com) |  [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) | [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/) |
| Requires payment details before it can be used | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Limits on free usage | Free use limited to 2,500 requests per day. | After providing payment details, most users receive $200 of free credit per month.  | Poorly defined usage limits.<br>Unexpected geocoding failure can happen at any time and is difficult to resolve. |

See `vignette("free-usage-of-opencage")` for full information about free usage of {opencage}.

# Installation

Install the package with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("opencage")
```

Or install the development version using [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/opencage")
```

# Usage

You need an **OpenCage API key** to use this package, sign up for a free account and obtain your key from [https://opencagedata.com/dashboard#api-keys](https://opencagedata.com/dashboard#api-keys).

Running `oc_config()` in an interactive session will request your API key. After this has been done once your API key will be stored as an environmental variable for later use. See `vignette("opencage-api")` for more details.

## Forward geocoding

Forward geocoding is the conversion of addresses into coordinates, and is achieved with `oc_forward()`

```{r}
library("opencage")
oc_results <- oc_forward("221b Baker St, Marylebone, London NW1 6XE")
oc_results
```

The `data` column contains the goecoding results from OpenCage as a nested tibble. Use `unnest()` from `{tidyr}` to extract this data:

```{r include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r include=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
oc_results %>%
  unnest(cols = data)
```

`oc_forward()` can be provided with multiple addresses and restrictions on search terms, see `vignette("forward-geocoding")` for full details.

```{r}
oc_forward(c("High Street, Reading", "Main Street, Reading"),
           countrycode = c("GB", "US"),
           limit = 1)
```

To augment an existing `data.frame` with data from OpenCage, use `oc_forward_df()`:

```{r}
street_addresses <- tibble(
  number = c(1, 10),
  street = c("High Street", "Main Street"),
  city = c("Reading", "Reading"),
  countrycode = c("GB", "US")
)

oc_forward_df(street_addresses, placename = paste(street, city, sep = ", "), output = "all")
```

## Reverse geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geo coordinates into a street address, and is achieved with `oc_reverse()`

```{r}
oc_results <- oc_reverse(latitude = -36.85007, longitude = 174.7706)
oc_results %>%
  unnest(cols = data) %>%
  pull(oc_formatted)
```

`oc_reverse()` can be provided with multiple coordinates and be instructed to attempt to return the nearest road with `roadinfo = TRUE`. See `vignette("reverse-geocoding")` for more examples.

```{r}
oc_results <- oc_reverse(latitude = -36.85007, longitude = 174.7706, roadinfo = TRUE)
oc_results %>%
  unnest(cols = data) %>%
  select(oc_formatted, contains("road")) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


```{r}
df <- tibble(id = 1:4,
             lat = c(-36.85007, 47.21864, 53.55034, 34.05369),
             lng = c(174.7706, -1.554136, 10.000654, -118.242767))

oc_reverse_df(df, latitude = lat, longitude = lng, output = "all")

```

## Language

Address specific language is important and OpenCage combines many different datasets to support multiple languages. See `vignette("language")` for full details.

## Privacy and GDPR Compliance

See `vignette("opencage-gdpr-compliance")` for details about how OpenCage processes data sent through the API and how to ensure GDPR compliance.
